      by theater staff.  Note that if a transaction does not generate an email (for example,

      showing all birthdays starting 10 days from now until 10 days after
      that.  In other words, the email sent on January 10 would show
      birthdays from January 20 to January 30, the email sent on January 20 would show
      birthdays from January 30 to February 9, and so on.  The email is not
      sent to the customer, but to the Box Office Email address above.

      start over.

    session_timeout: >

      Number of minutes of inactivity after which a user is automatically
      logged out.  Setting it to a longer value is more convenient for most

      for logout after 1 week.
