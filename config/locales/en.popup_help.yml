    # General

    disable_admin: >

      Lets you switch between viewing the site with admin privileges vs. how
      a regular patron would see it.  

    download_to_excel: >

      Download this report as a .csv (comma-separated values) file, which can
      be opened in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet app.

    # Logging in

    secret_question: >

      If you set up a secret question and answer, you can use it to log in
      if you ever forget your password.

    # Store pages

    credit_card_verification_value: >

      The CVV (security) code is the last three digits of the
      number printed on the BACK of your card, or for AmEx, the FOUR
      digits printed in small type on the FRONT of your card.

    skip_validation: >

      Checking this box, which is invisible to regular customers, skips
      certain credit card prevalidations (including CVV checking) 
      normally performed
      before submitting the charge transaction.  Check this box at
      your own risk!

    # Seatmap editing

    seatmap_background_image: >

      Optional publicly-accessible URL of an image that will be
      displayed "behind" the seatmap.  The image must be in PNG, JPEG,
      GIF, or SVG format, and must have an aspect ratio (width divided
      by height) the same as that of the seatmap it belongs to.  A
      seatmap's aspect ratio is the number of columns of the .csv
      divided by the number of rows.

    # Customers and customer lists

    customer_labels: >

      You can 'tag' customers with labels of your choice, such as Volunteer,
      Merchant Partner, etc.  Labels can then be used in report generation.

    filter_by_valid_mailing_address: >

      A valid mailing address is one in which the street, city, and state are
      all non-blank.  The zip code could be blank.  To enforce a nonblank zip code,
      specify a value in the "Limit to zip codes starting with" option.

    filter_by_zip: >

      Patterns that match the start of a zip code, separated by
      commas. '945,946'  matches anything starting with 945 or 946.  '94'
      matches anything starting with 94.  '94,925' matches anything starting
      with 94 or anything starting with 925, etc.

    merge_customers: >

      To merge duplicates, select exactly 2 customer records.  Manual Merge
      lets you choose which field values are retained; Auto Merge
      automatically retains all nonblank field values, breaking ties by
      preferring the customer record that has had the most recent activity.

    delete_customers: > 

      When you Forget a customer, all their transactions (donations, purchases,
      etc.) are transferred to the 'Anonymous Customer', so sales reporting is
      unaffected.  This action cannot be undone.

    # Importing

    import_show_name:  >

      Because the format of will-call lists varies, you have to specify
      which show this is for.  If it doesn't exist, enter the name of a new
      show, which will be automatically created in order to import the
      list.  NOTE!  If you enter a new show name, that show will be created 
      even if the import is aborted or fails.

    import_choose_file:  >

      Each kind of import expects a specific file type and layout.  If these
      files are CSV (comma-separated values), be sure they have been saved
      as "Windows CSV".  Some imports also accept other file types.

    check_for_duplicates_after_import: >

      When automatically importing customers (such as from an external
      will-call list or spreadsheet), Audience1st cannot always tell for
      sure if two customers with similar names are duplicates.  After doing
      any kind of import, you should check for duplicates (Reports tab, under
      Database Maintenance reports) and use your judgment in merging them.
      It's best to do duplicate elimination as soon as possible, since
      duplicate records sometimes prevent customers from being able to login.

    # Editing shows and showdates

    show_listing_date: >

      The date the show will first appear on any customer-facing screens.
      Before this date, the show will appear not to exist.

    show_landing_page_url: >

      The URL of a page on your theater's Web site that has more information
      about the show.

    show_is_special: >

      Indicate if this is a regular show (staged performance), special event
      that isn't really a performance (fundraiser, sponsorship opportunity,
      etc.), or an event that involves enrollment (acting class, drama camp,
      etc.)  This determines what store page the event will be listed on,
      and in some cases affects how customers purchase; for example, the
      enrollee name MUST be provided for a course enrollment.

    show_patron_notes: >

      When a patron purchases a ticket for any performance of this show,
      this text can appear as part of the confirmation email.  Leave blank
      to use a generic confirmation email with the show name and performance
      date.

    show_description: >

      You can add an optional short description to a show or event (e.g. 
      "This show contains strong language") or explanations of special
      ticket prices (e.g. "VIP Ticket price includes a free glass of wine")
      that will appear whenever the customer selects that show or event for
      ticket purchase from the Buy Tickets page.

    showdate_type: >

      In addition to in-theater live performances, you can specify a live-streaming
      performance (patrons watch online at a specific time and date) or a
      stream-anytime performance (patrons watch video anytime they wish, up
      to a specified deadline date).

    showdate_description: >

      You can add an optional short description to a specific performance of
      a show (e.g. "Preview") that will appear next to that performance's
      date in the dropdown menu when the customer is purchasing tickets for that
      show.

    advance_sales_cutoff: >

      The time after which customers cannot self-purchase tickets online for
      this performance.  (You can set a default value for this in Admin >
      Options.) 

    max_advance_sales: >

      The maximum allowed advance sales/reservations for an in-theater performance,
      which may be less than the performance's house capacity (specified
      as part of the overall show information).  For streaming performances,
      the maximum allowed sales; leave blank for unlimited.
      The ticket availability shown to customers
      when they self-purchase/reserve, or via the RSS feed, is based on
      this number, so a performance whose max sales is 100 will report
      "sold out" when 100 tickets are sold, even if the house
      capacity is higher than 100 for that performance.

    keep_existing_redemptions_as_is: >

      If this box is checked, pre-existing redemptions will not be
      changed, and the value selected above will be applied only to
      redemptions newly created. If the box is not checked, then the
      value selected above will be applied to BOTH pre-existing and newly-created
      redemptions.

    reserved_seating: >

      Sets whether a performance is General Admission or reserved seating.
      A General Admission performance cannot be changed to reserved seating, nor vice versa, after 
      any reservations have been made for the performance.
      A reserved seating performance can be changed to use a different seat map
      if all existing patrons' seats can be accommodated in the new seat map.

    showdate_house_capacity: >

      For General Admission shows, specify the true (physical) seating
      capacity of the house, which must be greater than zero.  For Reserved Seating shows,
      the capacity is automatically determined from the seat map used.
      House capacity is used for sales reporting and for keeping track of how many seats are 
      available while checking in customers during Front of House
      operations.  
      Note that you can always set the maximum allowed advance sales
      for a performance to be lower than the house capacity.

    showdate_access_instructions: >

      For online (live stream or stream-anytime) performances, provide instructions
      for how to access the online version, including any necessary links, passcodes,
      etc.  This information will be included in confirmation emails as well as available
      to patrons when they sign in to view their purchases.

    show_sold_out_dropdown_message: >

      When a performance is sold out, what should appear next to the
      performance date in the dropdown menu on the ticket purchase page?  
      (Leave blank to display nothing special.)

    show_sold_out_customer_info: >

      When a customer tries to select a sold-out performance on the ticket 
      purchase page, what instructions or explanation should appear?  (For 
      example, you might direct them to call the box office to inquire
      about cancellations.)

    # Vouchers and voucher types

    vouchertype_display_order: >

      Controls the order in which voucher types are displayed to customers
      (on self-purchase screen).  Lower numbers appear earlier in the list.
      Numbers don't have to be consecutive, so you can add a vouchertype
      later and position it between two existing vouchertypes.  In case of a
      tie, or if you don't specify, the vouchertype created earlier appears
      earlier in the list.

    vouchertype_type: >

      A Bundle is a container for a collection of vouchers (e.g. a
      subscription).  A Single Subscriber Voucher is a voucher valid for a
      particular production included as part of a subscription (although
      Bundles can contain both Single Subscriber Vouchers and comps).  All
      other types of tickets that aren't comps are Revenue Vouchers.
      Nonticket Product can be used for things like ticket exchange fees,
      ticket add-ons ("A glass of wine at intermission"), etc.

    vouchertype_account_code: >

      If you use accounting software such as QuickBooks, sales of each
      voucher type can be associated with a particular account code when you
      generate reports.  If you don't use such software, you can leave this
      blank.

    vouchertype_season: >

      The season during which this voucher type is valid.  The season start
      date is based on the value you provide under the Admin options.

    vouchertype_availability: >

      Use "External Reseller" for tickets that will be sold through other
      channels such as TBA, Goldstar, etc.  Use "Box Office Use Only" for
      tickets that cannot be self-purchased online by customer (for example,
      special group sales).

    vouchertype_fulfillment_needed: >

      If purchasing this ticket type requires physically mailing something
      to the customer (e.g., mailing a subscription package or free gift),
      check this box.  This will cause all such orders to appear in the
      "Show Orders Needing Fulfillment" report (Reports tab).

    vouchertype_subscription: >

      If checked, the customer instantly becomes a Subscriber during the
      season this voucher is for.  Note that this option is available even
      for single tickets and for nonticket products.

    vouchertype_walkup_sale_allowed: >

      If this box is checked, this ticket type will appear on the Walk-up
      Sales screen.  Leave unchecked for any ticket types that require
      advance purchase.

    vouchertype_changeable: >

      If checked, customer can change/cancel a reservation associated with
      this voucher type online WITH NO FEE.  If you want to allow
      changes/cancellations for a fee, leave this box UNCHECKED and create a
      separate Nonticket Product voucher for box office use only
      corresponding to the change fee.  (At this time, the box office must
      handle such transactions.)

    vouchertype_clone: >

      Cloning a vouchertype saves time when creating similar
      vouchertypes each season.  Cloning creates a new vouchertype with the same
      account code, price, availability, and other attributes copied from
      the current vouchertype; you can then adjust manually.  For
      example, you can clone this season's "General admission" voucher for
      next season, and then just modify the price.

    # Valid_vouchers

    valid_voucher_max_sales_for_type:  >

      The maximum advance sales for this ticket type for this performance 
      (for per-ticket-type capacity controls).  
      A box office agent can always sell 
      beyond this limit either in advance or at walkup sales time; the limit 
      applies ONLY to customer self-purchase.

    valid_voucher_promo_code: >

      If you enter a promo code here, customers (but not box office staff) 
      will have to enter it in order to purchase this type of ticket for 
      this show.  You can associate multiple promo codes (separated by commas) with the same
      redemption, since their sales are reported separately. 
      Promo codes are not case-sensitive, so "Discount", "DISCOUNT", and
      "discount" are all equivalent.

    valid_voucher_sales_dates: >

      The start and end sales times apply to customer self-purchase only.
      Box office staff can start selling before the "Start sales" time
      and can continue selling beyond the "End sales" time and even
      after the performance has started.

    # Account codes

    account_code_donation_prompt: >

      When the customer lands on a donation page that collects donations
      specifically for this fund, you can prompt the customer to enter a
      comment to clarify how the donation should be applied.  For example,
      if you have an account code for production sponsorship, this prompt
      could ask the customer which production they wish to sponsor.
      Whatever the customer fills in becomes part of the comments of the
      donation record.  If this prompt is left blank, no comment box will
      appear for the customer to fill in.

    # Donations

    donation_search_by_letter_sent: >

      When viewing donations, you can mark off all the ones for which you
      have sent an acknowledgment letter.  Checking this box restricts your
      search to donations not yet acknowledged, making it easy to export a
      list of all the donation letters you have to send.

    # Reports

    sublists: >

      Sublists are named subsets of your master email list as maintained by
      MailChimp or ConstantContact.  By saving the result of a report as a
      sublist, you can then send an email campaign to just those patrons.

    select_dates: >

      To select custom dates, click on the menu dropdown, select the
      starting date, then select the ending date, then click OK.

    # Box office

    checkin: >

      Click a number in this column to "check in" that many people in the 
      customer's party as they arrive.  
      A highlighted number indicates people who have
      checked in.  
      Click the X to "un-check-in" everyone in that customer's party.

    checkin_reserved_seating: >

      Click a seat number to check in that particular seat.
      A highlighted seat number indicates someone who has checked in.
      Click the X to "un-check-in" everyone in that customer's party.

    checkin_house_capacity: >

      This is the ACTUAL (physical) capacity of the house, not the max sales
      cap for this performance.  Advance Sales is the number of advance
      tickets actually sold; Walkup Sales is the number of walkup tickets
      sold; Available is the number of actual physical seats remaining.

    boxoffice_manager_only: >

      Issuing this ticket type in this situation requires Box Office Manager
      privilege.
