Feature: add comps and reserve for a show

  As a box office worker
  So I can comp my best customers
  I want to add comp tickets for a particular performance

  Background: logged in as admin and shows are available

    Given I am logged in as boxoffice manager
    And 2 "Comp" comps are available for "Macbeth" on "April 20, 2010, 8pm"

  Scenario Outline: add comps to performance

    Given it is currently <time>
    When I visit the add comps page for customer "Armando Fox"
    When I select "Comp (2010)" from "What type:"
    And  I fill in "How many:" with "<number>"
    And  I select "Macbeth - Tuesday, Apr 20, 8:00 PM (2 left)" from "Reserve for:"
    And  I fill in "Optional comments:" with "Courtesy Comp"
    And  I press "Add Vouchers"
    Then customer "Armando Fox" should have an order with comment "Courtesy Comp" containing the following tickets:
      | qty      | type | showdate       |
      | <number> | Comp | Apr 20, 8:00pm |

    Examples:

      | time                 | number |
      | Apr 20, 2010, 8:15pm |      2 |
      | Apr 18, 2010         |      2 |
      | Apr 18, 2010         |      4 |
