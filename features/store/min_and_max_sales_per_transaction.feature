Feature: enforce minimum and maximum sales per transaction for a particular voucher type

  As a boxoffice manager
  So that I can offer Buy One Get One and similar promotions
  I want to enforce both a minimum and maximum number of tickets that can be purchased in one sale

  Background: performance with minimum and maximum purchase limits on a promotional ticket

  Scenario: cannot add fewer than minimum tickets per transaction to cart

  Scenario: cannot add more than maximum tickets per transaction to cart, even if seats available
