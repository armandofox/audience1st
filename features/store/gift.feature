Feature: Gift checkout

  As a patron
  So that I can gift tickets
  I want to checkout with gift tickets

Background:
  Given customer "Tom Foolery" exists with email "joe3@yahoo.com"
  And I am logged in as customer "Tom Foolery"
  And my gift order contains the following tickets:
    | show    | qty | type    | price | showdate             |
    | Chicago |   2 | General |  7.00 | May 15, 2010, 8:00pm |
  And the following customers exist:
    | first_name | last_name | email           | created_by_admin | street        | password | password_confirmation | city     | state |   zip | day_phone    | last_login | updated_at | 
    | John       | Lennon    | john@lennon.com | false            | Imagine St.   | imagine  | imagine               | Berkeley | CA    | 99999 | 510-999-9999 | 2009-01-01 | 2009-01-01 |

  And I go to the store page
