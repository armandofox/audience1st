Feature: import TodayTix sales

  As a boxoffice manager
  To easily merge TodayTix sales into our own sales
  I want to import sales lists from TodayTix

Background: logged in as boxoffice

  Given I am logged in as boxoffice
  And I am on the ticket sales import page
  And a show "Company" with the following tickets available:
    | qty | type                           | price  | showdate                |
    |   5 | TodayTix - half off (external) | $19.00 | October 1, 2010, 8:00pm |
    |   5 | TodayTix - half off (external) | $19.00 | October 3, 2010, 3:00pm |

Scenario: successful import creates new customers; then attempt re-import of same file

  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "two_valid_orders.csv"
  Then table "#proposed_import" should include:
    | Name on import | Import to customer       |
    | Moran, Maria   | Will create new customer |
    | Ray, Adrian    | Will create new customer |
  When I press "Import Orders"
  Then the following "TodayTix - half off" tickets should have been imported for "Company":
    | patron      | qty | showdate            |
    | Maria Moran |   3 | Oct 1, 2010, 8:00pm |
    | Adrian Ray  |   1 | Oct 3, 2010, 3:00pm |
  And I should see "4 tickets were imported for 2 total customers. None of the customers were already in your list. 2 new customers were created."
  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "two_valid_orders.csv"
  Then I should see "This list was already imported"
  And customer "Maria Moran" should exist with email "mmoran-rn98@not-hotmail.com"

Scenario: customer unique match on email; verify customer is linked to this import

  Given customer "Maria Moran" exists with email "mmoran-rn98@not-hotmail.com"
  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "two_valid_orders.csv"
  Then table "#proposed_import" should include:
    | Name on import | Email on import             | Import to customer       |
    | Moran, Maria   | mmoran-rn98@not-hotmail.com | Maria Moran              |
    | Ray, Adrian    | arrayavalani@not.gmail.com  | Will create new customer |
  When I press "Import Orders"
  Then I should see "4 tickets were imported for 2 total customers. One customer was already in your list. One new customer was created."
  And customer "Maria Moran" should have 3 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on Oct 1, 2010, 8:00pm
  And customer "Adrian Ray" should have 1 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on Oct 3, 2010, 3:00pm
  When I visit the edit contact info page for customer "Adrian Ray"
  Then I should see "Created by TodayTix import on Jan 1, 2010" within "#adminPrefs"
  And customer "Adrian Ray" should have the following attributes:
    | attribute | value                      |
    | email     | arrayavalani@not.gmail.com |

Scenario: customer non-unique match, boxoffice agent decides whether to import as new or select existing; imported order shows original import name, not matched name; imported customer has email

  Given customer "M Moran" exists with email "moran@example.com"
  And customer "Adrianna Ray" exists with no email
  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "two_valid_orders.csv"
  And I select the following options for each import:
    | import_name  | action                                    |
    | Moran, Maria | M Moran (moran@example.com) (123 Fake St) |
    | Ray, Adrian  | Create new customer                       |
  And I press "Import Orders"
  Then I should see "4 tickets were imported for 2 total customers. One customer was already in your list. One new customer was created."
  And customer "M Moran" should have 3 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on Oct 1, 2010, 8:00pm
  And customer "Adrian Ray" should have 1 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on Oct 3, 2010, 3:00pm
  But customer "Adrianna Ray" should have 0 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on Oct 3, 2010, 3:00pm
  And customer "Adrian Ray" should exist with email "arrayavalani@not.gmail.com"


Scenario: import includes comps

  Given a show "Company" with the following tickets available:
    | qty | type                       | price | showdate                |
    |   2 | TodayTix - comp (external) | $0.00 | October 1, 2010, 8:00pm |
  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "includes_comps.csv"
  Then I should see "importing these 3 'TodayTix - comp' vouchers will exceed your intended limit of 2"
  When I press "Import Orders"
  Then customer "Maria Moran" should have 3 "TodayTix - comp" tickets for "Company" on October 1, 2010, 8:00pm
  And customer "Adrian Ray" should have 1 "TodayTix - half off" tickets for "Company" on October 3, 2010, 3:00pm

Scenario: possibly wrong show

  When I upload the "TodayTix" will-call file "wrong_show.csv"
  Then I should see "This list contains an order for 'Wicked' on Sunday, Oct 3, 3:00 PM, but the show name associated with that date is 'Company'."
  But I should not see "This list contains an order for 'Company'"
