      <div class="container docs-inner">

        <p>
        I'm organizing a program I'll call "TheaterBucks" that would provide
        "eGift Cards" that could be redeemed at any participating
        East Bay 501(c)(3) community theater.  The goal of this page is to provide enough
        information for you to decide if your theater might be
        interested in participating.  If you're reading this, I
        assume you are a decision maker at a small-to-medium not-for-profit
        performing arts organization in the Bay Area.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program wouldn't cost anything for theaters, nor require
          any changes to existing
          sales processes, as long as your point-of-sale system(s)
          allow "Card not present" (CNP) credit card transactions,
          for which the credit card number can be manually entered
          instead of requiring the card to be swiped.
        </p>

        <h4>How would patrons buy eGift cards?</h4>

        <p>
          They would buy online through a site run by a company called
          Yiftee (to which I have no connection but with whom I've
          discussed this program at length).  The "home page" for
          the program would have the names and logos of theaters that
          accept the card, and a "TheaterBucks" branding (which I'm
          working on).  The patron can use their credit card to buy an
          eGift card in any amount (up to a preset maximum we choose)
          for themselves, for a friend, etc.  The recipient doesn't get a physical card; they
          get an email with (printable) redemption info as well
          as a link to check their balance anytime. 
        </p>

        <h4>How would theaters redeem the cards?</h4>

        <p>
          The card is just a debit MasterCard
          that works only at designated vendors that can accept
          MasterCard "card not present" (CNP) purchases.
          they get
          "e-certificates" with the credit card info of this debit
          MasterCard (and some branding).  Theaters would sign up to
          become a designated vendor.  Then you would run it as a
          credit card (not debit or gift card) and 
          key in the transaction like a phone order. Mastercard will
          validate. Do not go over the value of the card or the
          transaction will be declined. 
        </p>

        <h4>What would be the cost to the theater?</h4>
        <p>
          Nothing. Yiftee makes 
          money from the purchase fee and by getting a piece of the credit card fees you're
          already paying when the card is used.  There's no separate
          cost or paperwork.
        </p>

        <h4>My theater already does gift cards--why would we do
          this?</h4>
        <p>
          Theater-specific cards are great gifts for
            your <i>existing</i> audience; this is a way to reach new
          audiences because they are not  tied to one specific theater,
          but will still spend it on <i>some</i> participating theater(s).
          And more people going out to the theater is better for all
          theaters: a rising tide lifts all boats.
        </p>

        <h4>When are you planning to launch this?</h4>
        <p>
          Aiming for first quarter of 2023, or as soon as I get enough
          theaters on board to make the value proposition interesting
          to buyers!
        </p>

        <button class="btn btn-primary"
                onclick="document.getElementById('more').classList.remove('d-none');
                         this.classList.add('d-none');">I'm
          intrigued, show me more</button>

        <div id="more" class="d-none">

          <h4>What are the requirements for participating?</h4>
          <p>
            Other than being able to accept CNP transactions, we would
            ask your theater to "advertise" the card by placing a
            prominent link to it on your website (we can provide a
            clickable image and link), to have signage advertising the
            card at your box office (for walk-up sales, will-call,
            etc.), and ideally, plugging it during the curtain speech.
          </p>
          
          <h4>What range of value(s) would be available?</h4>

          <p>
            We can set whatever limit we want up to $250, though all
            participating theaters would be subject to the same limit.
            I was thinking $75-100, to cover the cost of two tickets
            to a performance and maybe a drink.  The goal is to get
            new people in the door, then you can hook them
            on <i>your</i> theater by giving them collateral pieces
            when they check in.
          </p>


          <h4>Would the card work for online purchases and in-theater concessions?</h4>
          <p>
            It will work with anything your theater
            sells that handles CNP transactions, whether online or
            on-site.
            You have the option of
            only accepting it for ticket sales, but I
            don't recommend that restriction.
          </p>

          <h4>Can the theater sell or promote gift cards?</h4>
          <p>
            They can only be purchased online, but you can put a
            branded sign or poster with a QR code for customers who
            are interested, and you can "plug" them in your curtain
            speech.  I would hope and expect that if theaters agree
            that selling more cards is great for getting more people
            into theaters, they would want to publicize/promote these
            in curtain speeches, program ads, email marketing, etc.  I
            will provide sample text and collaterals that can be used
            as a starting point for this.
          </p>

          <h4>Can the theater check a customer's gift card balance?</h4>
          <p>
            The patron can check their own balance online, but
            there's no way for you to check it. If they try to pay for a
            transaction that exceeds the balance, it will be denied, but
            you won't have any way of knowing what the balance is.
          </p>

          <h4>What happens if a customer's card balance isn't enough to
            buy ticket(s)?</h4>

          <p>
            At your discretion, they can use the card for concessions or
            other items sold in-theater as long as those sales can be
            processed through a CNP transaction.  Or, if your ticket
            system allows a single transaction to be split across
            multiple credit cards, they can use the gift card for the
            balance and pay the rest by some other means. 
          </p>

          <h4>What analytics/reporting will my theater get that could
            be used for marketing purposes?</h4>

          <p>I'm working on the answer.</p>

          <h4>Could the "landing page" where people go to check
            balance, buy a card, etc. include content that changes
            periodically, like having links to the latest production's
            landing pages?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, I'll work something out where we can roll in changes
            once a month or something.
          </p>

          <h4>Who makes money from this?</h4>

          <p>
            Yiftee, the company that administers the card, gets a
            fee when the card is purchased ($1 plus 5% of the card
            value), and gets a share of the credit
            card fees you're already paying.  You 
            make money when patrons use the card at your theater.
            Nobody else makes money, and certainly not me; I'm doing this because I am
            looking for more ways for theaters to bring in new
            audiences.
          </p>

          <h4> Can I apply a refund to the eGift Card?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Refunds can be applied to a valid (unexpired) card just as you would to a credit card.</p>

          <h4> Since the eGift Card is like a Mastercard, can it be redeemed anywhere?</h4>
          <p> No. They can only be redeemed at participating theaters.</p>

          <h4>Can the eGift Card be used more than once?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes. They are multi-use and the current balance and
            expiration date are always reflected on the digital
            voucher. Recipients receive monthly reminders to
            redeem.</p>
