        <p>
        I'm organizing a program that would provide
        electronic gift cards that could be redeemed at any participating
        East Bay 501(c)(3) community theater.  The goal of this 1-pager is to 
        help you decide if your theater might be
        interested in participating.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program wouldn't cost anything for theaters, nor require
          any changes to existing
          sales processes.  The goal is to boost overall theater patronage
          (which benefits everyone) by enabling people to give the
          gift of live theater without tying the recipient to a
          single venue.
        </p>

        <h4>How would patrons buy TheaterBucks cards?</h4>

        <p>
          They would buy online through a site run by a company called
          Yiftee (to which I have no connection but with whom I've
          discussed this program at length).  The "home page" for
          the program would have the names and logos of theaters that
          accept the card and "TheaterBucks" branding (which I'm
          working on).  The patron can use their credit card to buy an
          eGift card in any amount (up to a preset maximum we choose)
          for themselves, for a friend, etc.  The recipient doesn't get a physical card; they
          get an email with (printable) redemption info as well
          as a link to check their balance anytime. 
        </p>

        <h4>How would theaters redeem TheaterBucks cards?</h4>

        <p>
          The card is just a debit MasterCard
          that works only at designated vendors that can accept
          MasterCard "card not present" (CNP) purchases.
          Recipients get
          "e-certificates" with the credit card info of this debit
          MasterCard (and some branding).  You would run it as a
          credit card (not debit or gift card) and 
          key in the credit card number like a phone order.  Or
          patrons can use the credit card info when buying tickets online. 
        </p>

        <h4>What would be the cost to the theater?</h4>
        <p>
          Nothing. Yiftee makes 
          money from the purchase fee and by getting a piece of the credit card fees you're
          already paying.  There's no separate
          cost, reporting, or paperwork (other than signing
          the <a href="https://yifteeutil.com/commcard_merch_agreement"
                 target="_blank">Merchant Agreement</a>). 
        </p>

        <h4>My theater already does gift cards&mdash;why would we do
          this?</h4>
        <p>
          Theater-specific cards are great gifts for
            your <i>existing</i> audience. This is a way to reach
          potential new
          audiences because they are not  tied to one specific theater.
          And more people going to the theater is better for all
          of us&mdash;a rising tide lifts all boats.
        </p>

        <h4>When are you planning to launch this?</h4>
        <p>
          Aiming for first quarter of 2023, or as soon as I get enough
          theaters on board to make the value proposition interesting
          to buyers!  Contact me (see below) to hear about who's
          already on board.
        </p>

        <button class="btn btn-primary"
                onclick="document.getElementById('more').classList.remove('d-none');
                         this.classList.add('d-none');">I'm
          intrigued, show me more</button>

        <div id="more" class="d-none">

          <h4>What are the requirements for participating?</h4>
          <p>
            The ability to accept CNP transactions at any point where
            you want the card to be redeemable, whether online or onsite.
          </p>
          
          <h4>What range of value(s) would be available?</h4>

          <p>
            We can set whatever limit we want up to $250, though all
            participating theaters would be subject to the same limit.
            I was thinking $75-100, to cover the cost of two tickets
            to a performance and maybe a drink.  The goal is to get
            new people in the door, then you can hook them
            on <i>your</i> theater by giving them collateral pieces
            when they check in.
          </p>


          <h4>Would the card work for online purchases and/or in-theater concessions?</h4>
          <p>
            It will work with anything your theater
            sells that handles CNP transactions, whether online or
            on-site.
            You have the option of
            only accepting it for ticket sales, but I
            don't recommend that restriction.
          </p>

          <h4>Can the theater sell or promote gift cards?</h4>
          <p>
            They can only be purchased online, but you can put a
            branded sign or poster with a QR code for customers who
            are interested, and you can "plug" them in your curtain
            speech, on your website, near the box office, in your
            email marketing, etc. We
            will provide sample text and collaterals that can be used
            as a starting point for this.
          </p>

          <h4>Can the theater check a customer's gift card balance?</h4>
          <p>
            The patron can check their own balance online, but
            there's no way for you to check it. If they try to pay for a
            transaction that exceeds the balance, it will be denied, but
            you won't have any way of knowing what the balance is.
          </p>

          <h4>What happens if a customer's card balance isn't enough to
            buy ticket(s)?</h4>

          <p>
            At your discretion, they can use the card for concessions or
            other items sold in-theater as long as those sales can be
            processed through a CNP transaction.  Or, if your ticket
            system allows a single transaction to be split across
            multiple credit cards, they can use the gift card for the
            balance and pay the rest by some other means. 
          </p>

          <h4>What analytics/reporting will my theater get that could
            be used for marketing purposes?</h4>

          <p>I'm working on the answer.</p>

          <h4>Could the "landing page" where people go to check
            balance, buy a card, etc. include content that changes
            periodically, like having links to the latest production's
            landing pages?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, I'll work something out where we can roll in changes
            once a month or something.
          </p>

          <h4> Can I apply a refund to the eGift Card?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Refunds can be applied to a valid (unexpired) card just as you would to a credit card.</p>

          <h4> Since the eGift Card is like a Mastercard, can it be redeemed anywhere?</h4>
          <p> No. They can only be redeemed at participating theaters.</p>

          <h4>Can the eGift Card be used more than once?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes. They are multi-use and the current balance and
            expiration date are always reflected on the digital
            voucher. Recipients receive monthly reminders to
            redeem.</p>
          
          <h4>Why are you doing this?  Who makes money from this?</h4>

          <p>
            Yiftee, the company that administers the card, gets a
            fee when the card is purchased ($1 plus 5% of the card
            value), and gets a share of the credit
            card fees you're already paying.  You 
            make money when patrons use the card at your theater.
            Nobody else makes money, and certainly not me; I'm doing this because I am
            looking for more ways for theaters to bring in new
            audiences.  More viable theaters means more places where I
            can work as Music Director. &#128513;
