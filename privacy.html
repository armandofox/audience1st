      <h1 class="title text-center">Audience1st Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h1>
      
      <div class="container docs-inner">
        <p>
          Audience1st software ("A1") is used by several arts
          organizations (the "Organizations") to steward their audiences, sell
          tickets and subscriptions, and accept donations from their Patrons.
          This policy describes what information is collected and how it is used.  By
          transacting with an Organization that uses A1 (as identified by
          the phrase "Powered by Audience1st" in the footer of their
          ticket-sales and donations pages), you agree to the below
          terms, and you also agree to the Organization's own terms of service and
          privacy policy for how they use this data.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title text-center">Collection of personally identifiable information (PII)</h4>
        <p>
          Individual patrons may sometimes
          enter personal identifiable information ("PII") such as names
          and contact information as part of transacting with an Organization.
          A1 and its stewards will never access, analyze, or disclose PII
          to any other party except
          (a) as required to comply with applicable laws and (b) to assist
          the Organizations in resolving specific operational issues.
          While no information technology is one hundred percent secure, A1
          takes strong precautions to ensure that such information
          is securely transmitted and securely stored.

        </p>
        <p>
          Each Organization has complete control over its own patron data
          and may have additional policies regarding how they use it.
          At the request of any Organization, A1 will destroy all extant
          copies of any patron data.  

        </p>
        <p>
          Patrons wishing to have their data expunged should directly
          contact the Organization holding the data.

          <h4 class="title text-center">Communication</h4>

        <p>
          The only direct communication between A1 and any Patron
          consists of individual transaction-confirmation emails.  Patrons
          will never receive any other email of any kind from A1, though
          they may (depending on the policy of the Organization) receive
          other email such as marketing communications from the
          Organization.


        </p>
        <p>
          Patrons will never receive any solicitation of any kind from A1,
          and in particular, will never be asked for their login
          information or any other PII.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title text-center">Credit Card Information</h4>

        <p>
          <b>
            No information about your credit card number or account ever
            passes through or is collected by A1's computers, nor made available to any
            Organization.
          </b>

        </p>
        <p>
          All credit card transactions are handled directly by
          <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center">Stripe,
            which has sole access to
            your credit card information and manages it according to their Privacy Policy.</a>
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="title text-center">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>

        <p>
          In the language of GDPR, A1 is a data processor, not a data
          controller.  We process Patrons' PII as needed to fulfill the
          functions used by the Organizations using A1.  The Organizations
          are GDPR data controllers.  EU citizens wishing to exercise
          specific rights under the GDPR should communicate directly with
          the Organization that collected the data.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title text-center">Cookies</h4>

        <p>
          A1's correct operation relies on cookies--small data files that
          we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes,
          such as to keep you logged in, differentiate you from other Patrons,
          enable certain navigation features of A1, and monitor the site for
          correct operation.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its
          options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
          cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, you
          will be unable to complete most transactions using A1.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title text-center">Third Parties</h4>

        <p>
          A1 makes use of third party services to facilitate its
          operations, including maintenance services, database management, and
          web analytics.  To the extent that any third party has access to PII,
          they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose
          than ensuring correct operation of the specific service(s) they
          provide to A1.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title text-center">Children Under 13</h4>

        <p>
          In accordance with COPPA,
          %span.strong patrons under 13 years of age should not use A1 at any time or in any manner.
          A1 does not knowingly collect or maintain PII about such
          Patrons, and if A1's stewards learn that such information has been
          collected, we will take the appropriate steps to delete it.
          If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who
          uses A1, please
          contact the Organization through whom the information was
          collected to have that childâ€™s information deleted, as A1 does
          not use or analyze Organizations' information about Patrons
          except as above.
        </p>
