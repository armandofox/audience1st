System Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:overview-vouchers"></A>
<BR>
Patrons, Vouchers,  Reservations, Bundles, and Tickets
</H2>

<P>
The <I>patron</I> is the unit to which most operations are indexed.
Ticket vouchers (see below) are linked to
patrons; donations are linked to patrons.

<P>
The <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>operates on the basis of ticket <EM>vouchers</EM><A NAME="132"></A>. A
voucher is the equivalent of a ticket that can be used to make a
reservation, but the voucher is not itself a reservation. The voucher is
instead the unit of fulfillment.  

<P>
A patron who holds a voucher can use it to make a <I>reservation</I>.
The reservation ``ties'' the voucher to a specific show date.
If the reservation is cancelled, this ``tie'' is broken but the voucher
itself remains, and can be used for a different reservation later.

<P>
Each voucher is of a particular <EM>voucher type</EM><A NAME="134"></A>, as defined by the <EM>Box
Office Manager</EM><A NAME="136"></A> (BOM).  The BOM indicates
which voucher types are valid for a particular performance.  Even after
a performance is set up and available for reservations, new voucher
types can be created and made valid for that performance.  If a voucher
is able to be redeemed for a particular performance, we say that it is a
<EM>valid voucher</EM><A NAME="138"></A> for that performance.

<P>
A <EM>bundle</EM><A NAME="140"></A> is a collection of vouchers sold as a single unit.
A simple example is a subscription, which might contain three vouchers
valid for any musical and two vouchers valid for any play.  But bundles
can also be used for offering multi-ticket promotions that are not
subscriptions.  For example,  a ``family pack''
bundle could include 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, purchased
together for a discount price.  Adding a bundle product to a patron's
account causes the corresponding individual vouchers to be
added to the patron's account, after which point they behave just like
regular vouchers.  

<P>
A <EM>ticket</EM><A NAME="142"></A> is a special kind of voucher that is ``tied'' to a
particular performance <I>at the time of purchase</I>.  Generally these
are cash purchases  by nonsubscribers to attend a  particular
performance.  Single tickets can be purchased ``anonymously'', <I>without</I> 
creating a login account; but to purchase any kind of bundle, including
a subscription or promo, the patron must have a login.

<P>
Vouchers, bundles and tickets are the <I>products</I> offered for sale.
However, each voucher type, bundle, and ticket type is marked to
indicate whether it is offered for sale to the general public, to
subscribers only, or to box office/administrators only.  For example,
courtesy tickets could be offered for customer service purposes, but
only the box office can add that type of ticket to an account.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Patron's View</A>
</H2>

<P>
We distinguish a <I>patron</I>, who has an account established in our
system, from a <I>guest</I>, who does not.  An account is necessary in
order to purchase subscriptions or bundle promos, but not all patrons
have vouchers in their accounts.  In other words, our patron list is our ``known
customer list'', but not all patrons are active.

<P>
A patron logs in to the <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>using any Web browser.  (The first time they
do this, their password will have to be setup by a Box Office
Associate; the patron can change it herself later.)

<P>
Once logged in, the patron sees a list of all their vouchers.  Some
vouchers may be marked as ``available'', meaning they have not yet been
``tied'' to a performance via a reservation.  Clicking on one of these
will allow the patron to make a reservation against that voucher.
A patron can also cancel a reservation, which makes the voucher
available for a different reservation.

<P>
Guests without accounts are directed to a <EM>storefront</EM><A NAME="145"></A> where specific
products are offered for credit card sale.  If the patron attempts to
purchase a subscription or bundle product, part of the purchase process
requires them to create an account.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
Backoffice View</A>
</H2>

<P>
The various administrative users of the system are just patrons who have
special privileges.  They login and see the same screens that patrons
see, but they also have access to certain screens and operations that
patrons do not.  The levels in order of increasing privilege are:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Patron</DT>
<DD>The default level: can log into her own account, manage
  her own reservations, and edit her own contact information.
</DD>
<DT>Staff</DT>
<DD>Can also generate reports, including mailing lists, box
  office statistics, etc.  Can record
  donations, search and update patron contact information, and manage
  the ``Resources'' database (patrons who are also professional service
  providers, professional connections to other organizations, etc.) This
  is the appropriate category for any 
  staff member who does not deal directly with reservation processing.
</DD>
<DT>Walkup Sales</DT>
<DD>can also do day-of-show box office procedures, such
  as generating the will-call list and processing walkup sales
  transactions.
</DD>
<DT>Box Office Associate</DT>
<DD>Can also make and cancel advance
  reservations, search the patron database, update patron information,
  add and remove vouchers from patron accounts, and generate attendance lists for performances.
</DD>
<DT>Box Office Manager</DT>
<DD>Can add/edit shows, add/edit performance dates,
  add/edit voucher types and bundle types, determine which voucher types
  can be redeemed for which performances.
</DD>
<DT>Administrator</DT>
<DD>Can grant/revoke any of the above privileges to
  other users and perform additional direct manipulation of database tables.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
All backoffice actions are <EM>audited</EM><A NAME="147"></A>, with
permanent records being written of who performed a particular action and
when.  Thus, it is possible to distinguish (e.g.)  whether a patron
logged in and changed their own contact information or whether it was
changed by a Box Office Agent, and if so, who.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00023100000000000000">
Walkup Sales/Box Office Associate's View</A>
</H3>

<P>
A Box Office worker who handles walkup sales has access to the necessary
functions for processing walkups.

<P>
A Box Office Associate (BOA) who also works with advance reservations
has additional capabilities:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Switch User</DT>
<DD>The BOA can search for a patron by name
  and then bring up that patron's record.  From that point on, the BOA
  can do anything the patron could do if the patron had logged in
  themselves.
</DD>
<DT>Add Vouchers</DT>
<DD>The BOA can, with some restrictions, add vouchers
   to a patron account.
</DD>
<DT>Record Donations</DT>
<DD>The BOA can record donations made by the
  patron. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00023200000000000000">
Box Office Manager's View</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Box Office Manager (BOM) can do everything the BOA can do, and can
also add new shows and show dates.

<P>
Logically, a <EM>show</EM><A NAME="149"></A> is a single production that has a run start date,
a run end date, and some other properties.  Each show is associated with
one or more <EM>show dates</EM><A NAME="151"></A>, each of which represents a single
performance.  In particular, when a
reservation is made against a voucher, the reservation ties the voucher
to a particular show date.

<P>
A show date includes various kinds of information such as:

<UL>
<LI>Date and time of the performance
</LI>
<LI>Capacity of the house for the performance
</LI>
<LI>Which voucher types are valid for that performance, including the
  following information for each valid voucher type:

<UL>
<LI>limits (if
      any) on how many vouchers of each types can be redeemed for that
      performance. For example, we may offer discount seats but allow at
      most 10 seats per show to be released as discount.
</LI>
<LI>Starting and ending date when reservations can be made for a
      particular show using this voucher type.
</LI>
<LI>Whether a promo code or password is needed to redeem this
      voucher type. This feature will be used in the future.
  
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00023300000000000000">
Administrators' View</A>
</H3>

<P>
An Administrator (admin) can do anything, including operations that are
potentially dangerous to the database.  For example, permanently
deleting a patron is ``dangerous'' because past donations made by that
patron would no longer be linkable to an individual.  The administrator
is also the only privilege level that can add or remove privilege for
other users.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:navigation"></A>
<BR>
Basic Navigation: Yellow Means Privilege
</H2>

<P>
The basic navigational aid in <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>is the use of color.

<P>
Elements in <I>yellow</I> on the screen are ones
that you are seeing because of your administrative
privilege, but that a patron would not see.

<P>
For example, when a patron views her own account, she has the ability to
make or cancel reservations, but <I>not</I> the ability to add or remove
vouchers from her own account (except by purchasing through the
Storefront).  Howver, when a Box Office Agent is viewing that same
patron's account, a yellow button labeled ``Add Vouchers''
will be displayed.  The yellow means that the patron would not see this
element but the box office associate does see it.

<P>
The most obvious yellow navigational aid is the <EM>main navigation bar</EM><A NAME="154"></A>
(navbar), 
which appears at the top of every screen for backoffice staff but is never
seen by patrons.  The navbar gives access to the  main functions of <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>:
Customers, Reservations and Donations (chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:boa">2</A>), Shows and Show Dates
(chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:bom">4</A>), Transaction Search (chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:boa">2</A>),
Tickets and Subscription Types (chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:bom">4</A>), Reports
(chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:staff">3</A>), and a button to Log Out of the system.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:login"></A>
<BR>
Logging In
</H2>

<P>
All users--patrons or otherwise--see the same interface for logging
in.  To <EM>login</EM><A NAME="157"></A>, go to <TT><A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena">http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena</A></TT> and enter your
login (email address) and password.  Note that since ``back office''
users are just patrons with extra privilege, backoffice staff wishing to
make reservations on behalf of a patron should just login as
themselves--not as the patron.  Once logged in, they will be able to
access accounts of other patrons.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00026000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:test"></A>
<BR>
Test System
</H2>

<P>
There is a <EM>test system</EM><A NAME="159"></A> available for backoffice users
that allows you to safely do operations on a ``sandbox'' database that
is completely separate from the real database.  You need to have a
separate login to use the test system (though you can choose to make it
the same as your login for the real system).

<P>
The test system is for
training and testing purposes and is always accessible at
<TT><A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena-test">http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena-test</A></TT>. It is protected by a master
username and password (which you'll have to enter <I>before</I> you see
the login screen).  Ask your system administrator what the master
username and password is.

<P>
You can tell when you are using the test system because there will be a
bright red border around every page. This border is absent when using
the production system.

<P>
TBD: how to distinguish build number of development system from build
number of production system.

Incorporating Into External Web Site
</H2>

<P>
As a convenience feature, a specific URL of AudienceFirst can be used to
get a quick status of whether tickets are available for <I>this
  week's</I> shows.  <I>This week</I> means ``any day between today and
next Monday.''  To do this, fetch from the URL
<TT><A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena/thisweek">http://www.audience1st.com/Altarena/thisweek</A></TT>.  What will be returned
is one or more lines (separated by the Unix newline character <code>\n</code>)
corresponding to each of this weekend's performances.  Each line has the
form <I>ShowName - ShowDate: Disposition</I> where <I>ShowName</I> is the name
of the show, <I>ShowDate</I> has the form ``May 12, 8:00'' (i.e., a date
and a time in 12-hour format), and <I>Disposition</I> is one of the
following three strings:

<UL>
<LI><code>SOLD OUT</code>--the performance is sold out
</LI>
<LI><code>Available</code>--advance tickets are still available online
</LI>
<LI><code>Available at Box Office only</code>--there are still seats
  remaining, but advance sales have ended
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In the future this information will be provided in XML format as well.
For the time being, the easiest way to include this information in
another website would be an IFRAME, e.g.:

Box Office Associate's Guide
</H1>

<P>
This chapter covers basic box office procedures including making and
cancelling reservations, recording donations, and day-of-show box office
procedures (generating attendance lists, etc.).  You must have at least
Box Office Associate privilege to access these screens and perform these
tasks.

The Patron Database Is Golden
</H2>

<P>
Our list of patron information is one of our biggest assets.  A few
words about its stewardship are therefore in order.

<P>
<B>Mailing addresses:</B> Patron address information is used for doing
mailings. When adding or updating a patron record, if you are not sure
about a patron's address, leave it blank. <I>Don't</I> fill in ``N/A''
or ``Unknown'' or something like that; just leave it empty.  The same
goes for the email address.

<P>
<B>First and Last Names:</B> Patron names are used both for mailings
and for communication with patrons.  If a couple wants to use different
first and last names and want to keep their records distinct, then
create separate records.  If John Smith and Carol Jones are a couple and
they're OK having the same last name in our database, ``John and Carol''
for first name and ``Smith'' for last name is fine.  But if they want
their last names distinct, <I>do not</I> enter ``John/Carol'' for first name
and ``Smith/Jones'' for last name--create two separate records.

<P>
<B>Shared addresses:</B> Similarly, when two or more patrons share a
household, make every effort to ensure that the addresses are really
<I>identical</I> in the database.  In the future, we will have an
``address normalizing'' function that converts addresses to standard
US&nbsp;Postal Service format, but for now, please be aware that to save
money on mailings we often perform de-duplication of addresses, which
will only work if the addresses are identical.

<P>
TBD: Validation of mailing address, de-duplication/merging procedure.

<P>
<B>If you make a mistake</B> while entering a transaction, see
section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:recovering">6.1</A> for common procedures to recover from mistakes.

Looking Up a Patron or Determining Whether a Patron is a Subscriber
</H3>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>In the master navigation bar, click <I>Customers &amp;
    Reservations</I>.
</LI>
<LI>In the <I>Search/Filter</I> box, type a single word that would
  narrow down to the desired patron.  (In the future, multi-word and
  advanced searches will be supported.)  This single word (or part of a
  word) can be something that occurs in the customer's first or last
  name, address, city, or any other contact info field.
</LI>
<LI>If you see a match for the patron in the displayed list, you can
  click on the green arrow to go to that patron's record.  Note that if
  there are many matches, the ``Next Page/Previous Page'' links can be
  used to browse the search results.
</LI>
<LI>If you're sure the patron is not in the database, see
  section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addpatron">2.2.2</A> below to add them.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The patron's general information screen shows their contact information,
whether they are a subscriber (``Valued Subscriber'' appears below their

Email blasts are handled by a separate system called PHPlist.

<B>When you enter a new customer</B>: if you supply an email address
for the new customer, <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>will first check whether that email address
has already been registered in PHPlist.  (Possibly the patron added
herself to our email list <I>before</I> becoming a full-blown patron.)
If yes, then the <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>patron record will automatically be linked to the
corresponding PHPlist record.  If no, a new PHPlist record will be
created for the patron at the same time that the patron record is
entered in <EM>AudienceFirst</EM>.

<B>When you update a customer's contact info:</B> if the patron has an
existing PHPlist record, you will see a button beneath the patron's
email address that says <I>Update Email Prefs</I>.  Clicking this button

record for this customer.  On this screen, you can change which email
lists the patron is subscribed to, whether the user should receive
HTML-formatted emails, and the user's email address.

<P>
If you're updating the customer's contact info and you are adding an
email address where previously no email address existed for the
customer, a new PHPlist record will be created.  

<P>
<B>Important.</B>  The customer's email address as used for email
blasts <I>is distinct from</I> the customer's login on our system.
Suppose Joe Customer's current login on our system is <code>joe@my.com</code>,
and you receive a request to update Joe's email information.  You visit
Joe's record, click the <I>Update Email Prefs</I> button, and change his
email address in PHPlist to <code>joe@your.org</code>.  From now on, any email
blasts that we send will correctly go to <code>joe@your.org</code>.  But, when
Joe wants to login to our system, he will still have to login as
<code>joe@my.com</code>.  If the customer wants the login changed as
well, explain that the login is only used to allow them access to the
boxoffice system--<I>not</I> as the email address to send to.  If they

Manager sets up which vouchers can be redeemed for which show dates.
Possible criteria include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Advance sales start and cutoff: reservations can't be made before
  the start of advance sales or after the cutoff of advance sales.
</LI>
<LI>Capacity reached for voucher type: Some types of vouchers, such as
  promos, may be capacity-controlled, e.g. only 20 discount seats can be
  sold for a given show.  Some promo vouchers may not be valid at all
  for certain shows, e.g. matinee-only vouchers can't be used to reserve
  for an evening performance.
</LI>
<LI>Capacity reached for show: the voucher would be valid for the
  performance, but the performance is sold out.

Suppose patron John Doe has a ``valid for any musical'' voucher and a
``valid for any play'' voucher, and wishes to make a reservation for
<I>Urinetown, The Musical</I>.  If John selects the ``play''

  any vouchers that are marked as ``qualifies buyer as a subscriber''

</LI>
<LI>Only entries with validated US Mail addresses: limits to entries
  for which the customer address is believed valid.  Customer
  information entered by staff is always marked as valid at the time of
  entry.  Self-entered information (e.g. when customer purchases online)
  is marked as valid when the credit card transaction succeeds with the
  customer's address.  Use this option if you're generating mailing
  labels.

<LI>Remove duplicate addresses: consolidates to one entry per
  household address rather than per person.  For example, if we have a

  in our database, only one or the other of them will appear in the
  listing if this option is used.  (Currently, there's no way to specify
  which one it should be.)

Box Office Manager's Guide
</H1>

<P>
Whereas Box Office Agents can handle ticket sales and reservations for
performances, the Box Office Manager is the one who <I>causes tickets
  and reservations to become available</I> for shows.  The general process
of entering a show into the system, associating performance dates with
it, and indicating what tickets are redeemable for each performance is
collectively called <I>listing the show</I>.

<P>
It's important to realize that, in general, listing a show can involve
up to four steps:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Add the show</DT>
<DD>Enter the overall information for the show--start
  and end dates, default seating capacity, etc.  This step can be
  skipped if just adding or removing performance dates from an existing
  show. 
</DD>
<DT>Add show dates</DT>
<DD>Associate performance dates with the show (or
  remove performance dates).  Information such as the deadline for
  advance sales cutoff and the specific house capacity can be overridden
  for each show date.
</DD>
<DT>Indicate valid vouchers</DT>
<DD>Associate particular ticket types
  (General Admission, Subscriber, etc.) with the performance.
  <I>Without this step, the performances are listed but no vouchers
    can be redeemed for them.</I>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
In addition, the Box Office Manager can define new types of vouchers
(tickets) such as discount tickets, promotions, limited-capacity
tickets, etc.  In addition to <I>regular</I> vouchers, the Box Office
Manager can set up <I>bundle</I> vouchers; a bundle is a collection of
single tickets that is offered to the customer as a unit, for example, a
subscription or series package.

<P>
The next section covers how to set up both regular and bundle vouchers.
In general, you would set up most basic voucher types once only, and
only occasionally add new voucher types when you want to add a new
promotion or ticket type.

<P>
The subsequent three sections cover the three steps in listing a show:
entering show information (section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addingshows">4.2.1</A>), adding
performance dates for a show (section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addingshowdates">4.2.3</A>), and
indicating voucher validity for each performance date
(section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:validvouchers">4.4</A>).

Vouchers and Bundles
</H2>

<P>
There are two types of vouchers.  A <I>regular</I> voucher is a single
seat or ticket to a single performance.  A <I>bundle</I> is a package
that includes several regular vouchers.  For example, we may
offer a special 2-for-1 promo or kid-free-with-adult promo that is
limited to specific performances; to implement this you would create a
new voucher type representing this promo and then mark the voucher type
as valid only for certain performances.

<P>
When a new voucher type is set up, whether or not it is a bundle,
additional properties can be specified for it:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Expiration</DT>
<DD>A date after which the voucher expires and can no
  longer be used.  Useful for time-limited promotions.

Adding a New Bundle Voucher Type
</H3>

<P>
A bundle is itself a voucher that cannot be ``redeemed'' for anything
but serves as a placeholder.  For example, if a patron buys a
subscription containing 3 vouchers good for any performance, they would
actually see 4 vouchers in their account.  The first is a nonredeemable
``voucher'' that records the type of bundle purchase.  The remaining 3
are the actual vouchers that can be redeemed for seats.  This makes it
easy to figure out how many people took advantage of a particular
bundle promotion even if the promotion includes ``regular'' tickets.

<P>
In general, to define a bundle voucher, you <I>first</I> have to define the
regular vouchers that the bundle is going to include.

Adding valid voucher types for a performance makes those voucher types

<P>
To make a particular regular (nonbundle) voucher type valid for
redemption to a given performance, first be sure that the voucher type
exists (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addingregularvouchertypes">4.1.1</A>) and the show
date for which you want to allow redemption exists (see
section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addingshowdates">4.2.3</A>).  Navigate to the list of show dates
for the show in question (section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:addingshowdates">4.2.3</A>.

Next to each show date is the list of voucher types currently redeemable
for that performance.  (See figure XXX.)  If the voucher type you want
to make valid for the performance isn't listed there, click <I>Add

Common Customer Questions

Here are some answers to questions that commonly come up.

<P>
If in doubt, or if the customer is not mollified, there is usually a
Board member in the theater before most performances.  If there is no
Board member present, pass the complaint on to one of the Board members
when you can, get the customer's contact information, and assure them we
will get back to them.  They also have the option of  calling the
theater's number and dialing extension number 4.  That is the ``escalate to
the Board'' unpublished extension for customer griping.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00083100000000000000">
How much are tickets? Is there a student discount? A

</H3>

<P>
General admission is $20 adults, $17 seniors (62 and over).  For
certain performances, we offer a limited number of Student Super
Discount tickets at just $5 each.  When those tickets are unavailable,
the normal student price is $17.  Students are up to age 21 (college
undergraduates) and will be asked to show a valid student ID at the
door.

a message, or email reservations@altarena.org, to learn about buying
blocks.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00083300000000000000">
Can my group sit together?</A>

If you specifically do a block purchase (see above), we will hold seats
together for your block.  Otherwise, we are general seating on a
first-come first-served basis and <I>we cannot guarantee you will be
  able to sit together</I>.  Note that we allow our Subscribers to be
seated before any non-Subscribers are seated.  Your best bet is to
arrive early; doors open one hour before curtain and seating begins 30

(Updated March 15, 2007)

<P>
For our 2007 season, the guidelines are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Virginia Woolf is rated PG-13 for adult situations.  It is a
  dramatic play and includes conflict.  It is considered an American
  masterpiece and the movie version of it won five Oscars.
</LI>
<LI>The Last Five Years is suitable for preteens and older.  There is
  some mild language but the situations are rated PG.  It has a blend of
  happy moments and sad moments, just like real relationships.
</LI>
<LI>Oh My Godmother is rated PG for some slightly risqu&#233; humor.  It
  is an upbeat show with a happy ending.
</LI>
<LI>Urinetown is rated PG to G.  It is an upbeat, fast-moving show
  with a lot of humor and satire, some of which may not make sense to
  children under 12 or so.
</LI>
<LI>Morning's At Seven is rated G and is a gentle comedy with a happy
  ending. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Unless otherwise noted on our Web site, all <I>Spotlight Series</I>
concert events are family-friendly, designed to appeal to general
audiences, and appropriate for children ages 9
and up.  Events specifically suitable for even younger children will be
marked as such.

Changing Answering Rules
</H3>

<P>
The answering rules determine how incoming calls are handled based on
the day, time, and (optionally) where the call is coming from.  Call
handling options can include forwarding to another phone number; ringing
multiple phone numbers at once (in case you don't know where the
answering party will be); or going straight to voicemail.  (If a call is
forwarded and there is still no answer, it will also go to voicemail.)

<P>
This section covers the basics of changing the answering rules; see
RingCentral's online help for more complicated scenarios.

<P>
Login as above to extension 2.
Near right side of screen under ``Quick Links'', click
  <I>Answering Rules</I>.
The rules in the blue section of the screen are the ones you want
  to look at.  

<P>
Each rule has a ``When'' part, which says when that rule
should be triggered, and a ``what to do'' part.  Clicking on the
``When'' part lets you change the criteria of when this rule applies.
You basically specify a range of hours on each weekday.  (The rule
called ``Business Hours'' cannot be deleted or renamed, but it can be
changed.)

<P>
The ``what to do'' part has several options you can set for each rule:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>FindMe will cause the call to be forwarded to one or more
  additional phone numbers.  If FindMe is active, clicking on the phone
  number will take you to a screen where you can set up the FindMe
  criteria.  In particular, look at section 2 of that screen, ``Forward
  My Calls.''  You can list several phone numbers for forwarding, and
  specify whether they should be tried one at a time or all at the same
  time.  (The second option is for when you don't know whether the
  answering party will be at home or on their cell phone, e.g.)  If the
  call cannot be forwarded, it will go to voicemail.
</LI>
<LI>If FindMe is shown as ``Not Configured'' for a particular rule, it
  means call forwarding is not done for that rule.
</LI>
<LI>Take Messages Only will go straight to voicemail without
  forwarding the calls to anyone. (The voicemail will be left at this

Listing Tickets on Gold Star Events
</H2>

<P>
We usually offer a few tickets for 1/2 price on GoldStarEvents.com to
reach new audiences (GoldStar's emails reach over 30,000 people).  Our
usual policy is approximately:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>At least 10 tickets for opening night (more if sales slow)
</LI>
<LI>At least 10 for first matinee
</LI>
<LI><B>NO</B> discount tickets for Actors Benefit (first Saturday)
</LI>
<LI>About 6 tickets each for subsequent shows
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
These numbers can be adjusted if sales are particularly strong (or weak)
through our main channels.  The numbers can be adjusted after the
listing is sent to Gold Star, as long as we honor any tickets already
sold.

<P>
<B>There are two parts to listing GoldStar tickets for a show.</B>
First, you must ask GoldStar to list the tickets for us.  Second, you
must tell the AudienceFirst system to expect some GoldStar tickets.
Once these two steps are done, the will-call list sent from GoldStar
will be automatically received by AudienceFirst and integrated into our
box office listing.  If on the day of the show you have customers
claiming to have purchased through GoldStar but who aren't on the
will-call list, see section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:checkgoldstarsales">6.3.1</A> for how to
manually verify the GoldStar will-call list (in case there were problems
receiving it into AudienceFirst).

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Before you can submit a GoldStar listing, we must have a
page on our website (www.altarena.org) that describes the show.  You
will need the URL (Web address) of this page to complete this process.
