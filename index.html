          Audience1st is a web-based, all-in-one system for ticketing,
          subscriptions, development, and backoffice functions, designed
          expressly for the needs and budgets of small to medium sized
          nonprofit arts and cultural organizations.  Theaters in the San Francisco Bay Area have
          been relying on Audience1st for over 10 years.

          <dl>
            <dt> Does Audience1st work with online or streamed events? </dt>
            <dd>
              Yes! In Audience1st you designate whether each performance takes place in-person, is available 
              for live streaming at a specific time, or is available for streaming anytime
              during a specified time period.  
            </dd>
            <dt>How do people who buy tickets to an online event access the event? </dt>
            <dd>
              Audience1st does not host your online content; there are lots of
              great platforms out there for streaming and interactive online
              events. Audience1st allows you to provide instructions to patrons
              for how to access your online events. The patron will see these
              instructions when they purchase their ticket and they will also be
              included in the purchase confirmation email. Additionally, patrons
              can view access instructions at any time in their
              Audience1st account. 
              <dt> Does Audience1st provide telephone sales service to our patrons?</dt>
            <dd>
              Audience1st supports online sales and in-person (at the box office or front-of-house)
              sales.  However, your box office agents can accept phone orders and enter them into Audience1st.

            </dd>
            <dt> Is reserved seating supported?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes.  Any in-theater performance can be either general admission
              or reserved seating, even differing between performances of the same
              production.  If you can make a spreadsheet, you can create a seating
              chart. You can also create custom graphics as a background for your seating chart.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can you designate differently priced "zones" of reserved seating?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, and you can also designate differently priced tickets where the price differentiation is based on when they are purchased.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can Audience1st do dynamic pricing, in which ticket prices get higher as a performance gets closer to being sold out?</dt>
            <dd>
              You can do dynamic pricing with fixed price points.  For example,
              a particular type of ticket can be priced at $20, $30, or $40
              depending on how many remain.  You can do this by limiting the
              number of tickets that can be purchased at each price point,
              independently of limiting the total number of tickets sold for the
              performance. 

            </dd>
            <dt> Can you offer limited quantities of tickets that must be purchased within or during a certain time period (e.g. early bird or rush)?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, you can control start and stop sales time, and maximum sales allowed, for each ticket type as well as for a performance overall.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can you offer discounted tickets or comps by having patrons redeem "promo codes"?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, and you can choose whether to limit the quantity and/or redemption windows for each.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can you sell subscriptions?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, you can sell regular subscriptions, "flex passes", discounted
              subscriptions (e.g. for students or other specific groups), and so
              on.  Philosophically, we believe developing a subscriber base is
              critical to smaller organizations, and many features in Audience1st are
              designed around whether a patron is a Subscriber or not.  For
              example, you can choose to make certain ticket types available to
              Subscribers preferentially or exclusively, such as high-demand
              tickets or discounts if they bring friends; Subscribers are visually
              called out on the door list; you can optionally filter customer
              reporting by Subscribers vs. non-Subscribers; and so on.

            </dd>
            <dt> What if I also sell some discount tickets through Goldstar, TodayTix, or similar sites?</dt>
            <dd>
              Audience1st can import the will-call lists from third-party
              vendors and integrate them with your regular patron database, so
              you have all patron sales accounted for in one place and only one
              will-call list to manage at front-of-house time. 

            </dd>
            <dt> Does Audience1st support Pay-What-You-Can tickets?</dt>
            <dd>
              At this time Audience1st doesn't support the ability for the patron to specify 
              an arbitrary amount, but you can offer 
              tickets at multiple specific price points so that customers can choose the
              price most appropriate for their circumstances. You can also  sell
              the tickets as Comps at walkup sales time, and accept the
              corresponding donation.

          <dl>


            <dt> Will you set up my season for me?</dt>
            <dd> Audience1st is designed to allow self-setup of productions, performances, seating charts, and so on, to keep costs down for you, but we will work with you to train your staff to do this work.

            </dd>
            <dt> Does Audience1st track donations?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, patrons can donate directly online or you can manually enter check, cash, or in-kind donations, and run all the usual donation reports.  Credit card donations go through Stripe, which is low cost and offers nonprofit discounts.  Donations and ticket sales are tracked in one place for all patrons.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can donations be coded to different campaigns or funds?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, you can create landing pages that code donations to different
              account codes, which you set up and which are always included in
              exported reports.

            </dd>
            <dt> Do customers receive acknowledgments of donations automatically?</dt>
            <dd>
              Donations made online receive automatic email acknowledgments.

            </dd>
            <dt> Does Audience1st generate hardcopy letters to acknowledge donations?</dt>
            <dd>
              Audience1st lets you generate a list of <i>all</i> donations and generate mailing-list labels 
              to use with mail merge in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can I import my previous customer lists, donation/ticket history, and so on?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, we'll work with you to import whatever information you have, as long as you can arrange to get it in an exportable format (CSV, SQL, etc.)

            </dd>
            <dt> Do you back up my data?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, your data is backed up nightly, encrypted, and stored on
              separate servers.

            </dd>
            <dt> Do you see my data?</dt>
            <dd> You can choose to give us access to data as needed to address problems or concerns, but by default, your data is yours and we don't look at it unless you ask us to.

            </dd>
            <dt> How does my organization get paid?</dt>
            <dd> 
              You set up a Stripe account (free) that can be tied to your organization's bank account.
              All transaction revenue goes directly to you, usually within 24 hours of the transaction.
              Stripe deducts 2.9%+30 cents
              per transaction (3.5% for AmEx) directly from your revenue, with <b>no</b> other fees ever.
              We are never in the path of your cash flow and we have no visibility into your credit card processing.

            <dt> Can I sell tickets at the door?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, "walkup sales" by cash, check, or credit card (using Stripe
              for processing) are all easy, and those sales are also directly
              integrated into your main database.  
              You can even speed things up by purchasing an expensive (under
              $25) credit card "swipe" attachment that plugs into a
              USB port.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can I use Audience1st to sell concessions?</dt>
            <dd> Yes, you can sell fixed- and variable-priced retail items through Audience1st as well, so you can centralize all your credit card processing.

            </dd>
            <dt> How is check-in/will-call handled?</dt>
            <dd> You can generate a printed will-call list or use Audience1st's interactive check-in feature, which keeps track of how many have arrived (even if only part of a group arrives), how many are left to check in from advance sales, and how many available seats remain in the house.

            </dd>
            <dt> Does Audience1st print tickets on ticket stock?</dt>
            <dd> No physical tickets are produced.  It's 100% paperless, though printable receipts can be generated for patrons who desire them.

          <dl>

            <dt> Can Audience1st serve as my organization's main web site or home page, so that patrons never leave our site while conducting a transaction?</dt>
            <dd> 
              No, but we can match the look and feel of your existing web site,
              and we have plug-ins and widgets that make linking to and from
              your web site seamless.  The user experience will be very close to
              that of staying entirely within your site. 

            </dd>
            <dt> Can branding in the form of images, color palette, fonts, etc. be applied to Audience1st?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, you can customize all of this via a CSS file served from
              anywhere that serves static files (such as your theater's existing Web site).
              We'll help you set it up and your Web designer can enhance it from there.

            </dd>
            <dt> Do I need to know how to program in order to integrate Audience1st with our theater's site?</dt>
            <dd>
              No.  Audience1st generates links that will land patrons on a
              page for a specific production or even a specific performance of
              that production.  You just place those links in your publicity
              emails or on your theater's main site.
              
            </dd>
            <dt> Do patrons get confirmation emails when they do an online transaction?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes, this is included with Audience1st at no cost to you and
              with no setup needed on your part.  You can optionally provide an HTML template for
              "styling" these emails to match the UI of your website or marketing emails.

            </dd>
            <dt> Can I use Audience1st for marketing/publicity email campaigns?</dt>
            <dd> 
              Audience1st doesn't directly send marketing emails, but instead
              integrates with MailChimp, a best-of-breed and inexpensive email marketing solution
              that is highly recommended for nonprofits.  Your organization can set up 
              its own account with MailChimp, then connect that account to Audience1st.
              You can generate
              customer lists matching almost any imaginable criteria, such as
              "Customers who saw any performance of 'Hamlet' using a Goldstar
              discounted ticket", and export the result list to Mailchimp for an
              immediate email campaign.  If you  
              don't use MailChimp, you can export any report to Excel 
              for use with a different email solution or to print mailing labels.

            </dd>
            <dt> Do buyers get email reminders that their event is coming up?</dt>
            <dd>
              Not right now, but you can easily generate reports of who has
              reservations/purchased tickets for an upcoming performance and send
              that directly into MailChimp to do an email campaign.

          <dl>

            <dt> Audience1st is open source&mdash;does that mean it is free?</dt>
            <dd>
              Audience1st follows the same financial model as the open source WordPress software,
              which we have no connection to but we think is awesome.
              If you want to host and deploy it yourself (which requires
              substantial IT expertise), you may do so license-free and royalty-free.
              The <a href="https://github.com/armandofox/audience1st">code
                repository</a>  has
              instructions.  Or, we can host it for you and take care of all
              server operations, for a price that covers just our direct costs.  We're not
              looking to make money from this.

            </dd>
            <dt> Is there any long-term commitment or contract?</dt>
            <dd> 
              No, it's month to month.  You can stop anytime, and we will
              promptly send you an archive of all of your data in CSV and SQL formats.

            </dd>
            <dt> Who pays the credit card processing fees?</dt>
            <dd>
              When a patron purchases something, the money goes directly to your
              Stripe account and Stripe deducts their fees from there.  We do
              not touch your revenue stream at all. 

            </dd>
            <dt> Can't Audience1st just charge a service fee to the patron so we don't have to pay for it?</dt>
            <dd>
              We do not collect any  money from your patrons and we never will.
              This keeps us out of the critical path of your revenue stream.
              You can configure Audience1st to add a service fee to each order,
              but the decision whether to do that should be between you and your
              patrons, no one else. 

            </dd>
            <dt> Can you provide technical support to my staff for self-deployment?</dt>
            <dd> 
              The technical
              documentation is pretty thorough, but because we try to keep costs extremely low,
              we don't have the resources to do custom deploys.

            </dd>
            <dt> How long does it take to get started?</dt>
            <dd>
              We can have a site up and selling tickets/accepting donations for
              you in 24 hours.  Importing your 
              historical data
              may take a bit longer.  <a href="mailto:info@audience1st.com">Contact us</a>
              and we'll figure something out together.

            </dd>
            <dt> What steps does my organization have to do for setup, vs. which steps will you do?</dt>
            <dd>
              You will need to open a free account on 
              <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> (if your organization doesn't
              already have one) to receive payments from patrons, and once we
              have your installation set up (within 1 day), you'll enter some basic information
              like your organization's contact info, some preferences around how
              you want to handle various aspects of ticket sales, and the
              information to connect it to your Stripe account (and optionally
              your Mailchimp account, but you can always add that later).
              That's it.  

            </dd>
            <dt> Can I try it out before getting started?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes! <a href="mailto:info@audience1st.com">Contact us</a>
              and we'll set up a "sandbox" for you to try everything out free of
              charge and with no obligation.
