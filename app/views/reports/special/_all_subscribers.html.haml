%fieldset{:legend => @args[:name]}
  %p Include subscribers for the following season(s) (Apple-click or Ctrl-click to select multiple):

  = select_tag 'vouchertypes', options_for_voucher_types(), :multiple => true
  = hidden_field_tag '_report', 'AllSubscribers'

  %ul
    %li 
      Listing will not identify which season(s) a particular subscriber 
      belonged to; if you need that, run a report for each season separately.
    %li
      Remember this returns the list of <em>subscribers</em>, not 
      <em>subscriptions</em>.  A subscriber who purchased 3 subscriptions
      of the same type (e.g. for family members) is only counted once.
    %li
      Subscribers with same address and name who purchased <emph>different</emph>
      subscription types will appear separately.  To eliminate these 
      duplicates, check the "One entry per mailing address" box below.
