      Listing will not identify which season(s) a particular subscriber 
      belonged to; if you need that, run a report for each season separately.
    %li
      Remember this returns the list of <em>subscribers</em>, not 
      <em>subscriptions</em>.  A subscriber who purchased 3 subscriptions
      of the same type (e.g. for family members) is only counted once.
    %li
      Subscribers with same address and name who purchased <emph>different</emph>
      subscription types will appear separately.  To eliminate these 
      duplicates, check the "One entry per mailing address" box below.
