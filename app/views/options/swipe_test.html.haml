%h1 Test Your Card Swipe

%p 
  Plug in your card reader and scan a card.  No card information will be
  sent anywhere, but the card data will be displayed below so you
  can check if the reader is working correctly.

%p
  Note that the CVV code is <strong>not</strong> encoded on the magnetic stripe,
  so even with a properly functioning card reader, that code must always be
  entered manually.
