5329573,"""invalid email"" trying to process gift sub; CC charge occurs but order does not finalize/attach",invalid-gift-recipient,,,,epic,,,,"Dec 31, 2024",,,,"Reported as:
I have an order mess up in the system. It said: ""Sorry an unexpected problem occurred with your order. Please try again. Message: Validation failed: email is invalid""
For Gail Ahlborn.

the email is the same in our system. Any thoughts on if this is an A1st issue or a stripe issue?
",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/5329573,,,,,,"	screenshot attached: Kari tried the order 3 times, each time she got ""unexpected error: email is invalid"".

It is a gift order bought by Gail Ahlborn (cid 2146754459) for Megan Brown, for whom there are 2 records, one created 12/20 and the other 12/27, though the ordering problem here happened on 12/22 5:43pm-5:58pm.

- prior to kari having the issue, a customer Megan Brown (""megan #1"") was created on 12/20, as a side effect of someone who was not logged in but was trying to purchase a gift subscription for someone else.  this transaction was ultimately abandoned or failed (i'm working on ascertaining which).  

- to make it 'easy' to purchase gift subscriptions, A1 requires that the recipient either (a) uniquely exist already in the database, or (b) have either a phone number or contact email specified at the time the gift order is purchased, so there is some way to reach them.  in this case, a phone number was provided but no email.  this is bug #1: customers not created by an admin are required to have a valid email.  in this case, since the customer was created ""by the system"" as a side effect of being a gift recipient, they should have been marked as ""created by admin"" so that the valid-email requirement should not apply to them.  but the ""created by admin"" flag was incorrectly not set on the customer.

- two days later, kari tries to process a gift order with ""megan brown"" as the recipient.  she also enters the recipient info, and A1 correctly matches it up to Megan #1.   but megan #1 should not exist because the record as saved violates a validity constraint.  hence, when the order is placed, the ""unexpected error - email is invalid"".  note that this is a ""soft"" validity constraint - it is legal for a customer not to have an email as long as they were created by an admin, but as we saw, in this case that flag did not get set.

now, even with the invalid record issue, at first i was confused that this screwed up the transaction, because before the stripe call happens, there is a ""preflight check"" on the validity of all records that are about to be updated.  but critically, one step of that process - checking the validity of both the purchaser and (if applicable) the gift recipient - is bypassed if the order is being placed by an admin.  i think this is bug #2.  looking at the code, i can't quite figure out why these checks should be bypassed for admins, since the customer-creation validity checks already allow a customer without an email address (eg) to be created by an admin.

bug #1 is a straightforward fix that should be applied in any case.

for bug #2, i am inclined to remove the bypassing of the validity check that happens for admins.  i cannot think of a good reason why it's there, and if i do remove it, the worst that can happen is admins may now see an error that would otherwise have been masked (before any charge is attempted), and if the error is spurious, and we deal with it, it represents a temporary inconvenience to the admin but no loss to a patron.

note the tricky circumstances here:  if bug #1 did not exist (ie if Megan #1 had clearly  been marked as created-by-admin), bug #2 would not have been triggered because the preflight validity check knows to ""exempt"" admin-created customers from certain validations.

And, as we've seen this year, sometimes theaters have a one-off or irregular season with different start/end dates from usual. Right now Audience1st has one day of the year on which every season starts. I think that is not really correct. I think the ideal solution (in terms of serving theater needs, not in terms of development effort) is to have an entity called a season. A season would have a name (eg ""2020"" or ""2020-2021""), a start date, and an end date. The seasons tab and the page where you create a new show and also the vouchers tab would all have a dropdown list where you choose the season you want. The Seasons tab would also have a new button ""Create new season"" where you would provide the name, start date, and end date. We would warn (but allow) if you create a season that overlaps with another season or leaves a gap between seasons. You could delete a season only if it has no shows or vouchers. You could change the name of an existing season but not its start or end dates.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/4709442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goal of this story is to replace that with OmniAuth gem using the `identity` strategy initially.  

IMPORTANTLY, we should separate out into a new model - call it `Identity` - that has a correspondence to the `Customer` model but is separate.  The reason is that in the future I'd like to add ""login with Facebook"" etc, which is easy to do if authentication is factored into its own model.

The `Identity` model should be the place where all authentication related logic will live.  Some of that logic is now in `Customer.authenticate`, `ApplicationController#create_session` (which handles actually setting up a session and is called from various places in the app where login can occur, such as when the user sets up a new account), and `lib/authenticated_system` (which we will utlimately get rid of completely in favor of OmniAuth). `SessionsController` currently handles login workflow.

This should be broken into several stories, the very last of which involves removing all references to `lib/authenticated_system` and its tests.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/3777590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chocolate's tickets appear. Click Patron View button. The navigation tabs across the top disappear. I was not able to reproduce this bug on Altarena's live site, and on altarena-staging it only happens for some customers.

RESOLUTION:  Not a bug, and not related to r/s

This occurs if you do ""switch to patron view"" for a patron WHO HAS NEVER LOGGED IN.  this is an unfortunate but necessary side effect of ""Guest Checkout"".  recall that in guest checkout, we DO CREATE an account for the underlying customer, but they have no password.  as such, we effectively cannot grant them access to the kinds of things they would able to do if logged in (change contact info, etc).  hence there is logic that suppresses the nav tabs for those actions if the ""logged in user"" is actually a guest-checkout who has never setup an account.  the moment that user sets up an account for themselves, the nav tabs behave normally.  there is no way to change this behavior without breaking guest checkout, so unfortunately our customers will have to get used to it.  but the way i think about it is the admin is asking to see a 'patron view' that can never occur, because the patron cannot see that view themselves.  one (easy, low-priority) fix i could implement is to NOT display the ""patron view"" button on such pages.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168396042,Armando Fox,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- move the 'Go' button to below the select box and rename it 'Display on Screen'

- next to it should be another button, 'Download to Excel', that generates and downloads a .csv file of the desired report, with the following columns:

Show name (eg: Company)
Run Dates (eg: Mar 29 - May 5, 2019)
Show date (eg: Friday, Mar 29, 8:00 PM)
House Capacity (eg: 157)
Max Advance Sales for Performance (eg: 150) - this is computed by Showdate#max_advance_sales)
Voucher Type (eg: General Admission Musical-Adult)
Subscriber Voucher? (possible values: Yes or No)
Max Sales for voucher type (eg: 25) - this is given by each ValidVoucher's max_sales attribute; leave blank for ""Unlimited""
Sold (eg: 18) - number of seats of this type sold for this perf (like current on-screen report)
Price
Gross Receipts (eg 630.00) - total sales of this voucher type for this performance (just Price * Sold)


the csv file would therefore have one row per voucher type per performance date, sorted by show name, then performance date, then voucher type's display_order.  this basically should be do-able as one big ActiveRelation query (ie, do the joins in the relation, rather than first loading the show, then iterating over performance dates, then over voucher types, etc).  

there is no need for the file to have separate rows containing just the show name, etc.  the idea is to be able to easily apply Excel subtotaling to either sum up sales for a given show, for a given voucher type across multiple shows, etc.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/169792924,Casper Yang,xhe22,Xu Huang,,," (Armando Fox - Dec 4, 2019)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible ways to handle:
- Invariant: in-flight voucher always has valid seat number.  Assign ""default"" seat numbers from among available at import time, have boxoffice modify.
- Modify validations to allow seats to temporarily have NO seat number.  This is closest to existing behavior flows, its like customers trickling in their purchases.
- Modify seatmap JS to AVOID trying to set the status of a seat if its seat number is not in the seat map.  Dangerous because this means issues with ill-formed seatmaps or ill-formed in-flight vouchers may silently fail.

Still have not replicated on localhost though.  Vouchers can be subscriptions or not.

Order finalization code included a `transaction` block with a loop that calls Item#finalize!, which uses update_attributes! which apparently runs in its own txn.  so i suspect nested txns at some level were causing contention on large enough orders.

But the call to Item#finalize! is sort of redundant, since all the other attributes of the voucher are being set by assignment anyway inside the order's `transaction` block and will be saved when the Order gets saved because of the association.  So replacing the Item#finalize! call with a simple `item.finalized=true` was sufficient.  When this alternate code path was under a feature flag, we could reliably trigger the bug with the old code and avoid it under the exact same circumstances with the new code.

when showing orders for a walkup customer, the name ""WALKUP CUSTOMER"" should not be a link (to view all WALKUP CUSTOMER's orders).

On Altarena's production site right now (3/10/22), an HTTP-500 occurs when you do the following: Go to Front of House for the 3/26 performance of La Cage. Sell a ticket for cash to a walkup. Then click on the walkup sales report. Then click on the order number of the sale you just made. While looking at the order itself, click on the WALKUP CUSTOMER link. An HTTP-500 occurs.

On other systems (eg: sandbox) doing the above takes you to a screen that says ""WALKUP CUSTOMER's tickets"". Ordinarily you cannot search for WALKUP CUSTOMER in the customer search box. So it is not clear to me that a user should even be able to get here. 

Two possible solutions I see: (1) If we want staff to be able to access WALKUP CUSTOMER in this way, then we should fix the HTTP-500 that is occurring on Altarena production but not on sandbox. (2) If we do not see a use case for staff to be able to access WALKUP CUSTOMER in this way, then we should change the logic that displays orders so that when displaying an order for WALKUP CUSTOMER, the customer name is not a link to that customer.

When the patron enters their new password and clicks the ""Save changes"" button, they see a screen that has no tabs across the top.

This bug seems to only apply to accounts where the patron has never logged in before.
Found by Roger while working w/Crystal at Rhino.

Update: the problem is that one of the conditions for displaying the action tabs is if the customer has ever logged in. The reason is that if current_customer is set but the customer has NOT ever logged in, we might be in the middle of a store purchase flow for a new customer, in which case the tabs should NOT be displayed.  the fix is to mark a successful change-password action as a ""login"" by explicitly updating the `last_login` field.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/185979216,Armando Fox,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We should fix this bug by making the storefront work correctly with $0 subscriptions. However, this might be a lot of work for little gain. So an alternate solution that would be acceptable would be to make the Add Voucher page forbid $0 subscriptions. A theater can still give out a comp subscription by issuing comp single tickets instead.

Could we limit the result set to patrons who have had any activity in the last five years? That would be a quick and dirty solution, if it is a solution at all.

I think a very thorough (perhaps overkill) response would be to add an additional optional criteria that says ""Limit to patrons who have/have not made a purchase since <date>"". (This is analogous to the ""Limit to patrons who have logged in since"" option that already exists.) Then the report would first get a count of hits.

Roger has not been able to reproduce this bug (other than by clicking on the same reset link twice) but two different patrons have reported the behavior (both Altarena and Rhino). One provided a screen shot (in 9/7/23 email) and the curious thing about the screen shot is that both the email address and password fields are filled in on the page with the expired link message.

The page gives me the option to transfer these tickets to the June 24 performance. This is wrong for many reasons. (a) The June 2 performance uses reserved seating while the June 24 performance is general admission. (b) The voucher type sold (premium reserved) has no redemption for June 24. (c) The voucher type sold is redeemable for the June 3 performance and many others, but those dates don't appear in the dropdown list for transferring to another performance. (d) I am going to guess that this code was written before reserved seating and does not check to see that the actual seats are available when transferring to a new date. This is just a suspicion based on no facts. See Issue #2 for my guess as to the actual bug in play here.

Issue #2: If you go to Altarena's production site and go to front of house for An Evening with Margaret and Julia, December 10 performance and click the Whoops button, you'll see that they sold two walkup tickets. However, there is no ""transfer"" button. Based on issue #1 and issue #2, my guess is that the transfer button lists only general admission performances. (There are none for An Evening with Margaret and Julia and there is exactly one for Local Hero). To address issue #1 and #2 (if my guesses here are correct), I think we should allow transferring walkup sales to another performance only if both the actual sale and the new performance are general admission. For a reserved seating walkup sale that is for the wrong performance, we should require the box office to refund and reissue the ticket for the correct performance so new seats can be selected based on what is available. Also, when transferring from general admission performance to general admission performance, the system needs to make sure an appropriate redemption actually exists for the target performance.

Issue #3: It seems like the Whoops page should have a ""refund selected items"" button so that the box office person doesn't need to click through to the order. (This is a low priority enhancement request.)

Issue #4: The docs say you can use the Whoops button to transfer a walkup sale to an actual (non-anonymous) patron. I can't see how to do that. Is it possible?",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/184752980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
