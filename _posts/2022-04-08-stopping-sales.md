For various reasons, you may need to immediately "turn off" all
further sales or reservations for a performance.

The quickest way to do this is to go to Season tab and select the
production, and click on the date of the desired performance, which
brings up a screen to edit the details of that performance.

**Set the "Max advance sales" field to zero**, and confirm the dialog
warning you that this will effectively stop all sales.

Optional but recommended: you can also cause the show date to indicate
"(Cancelled)" in the dropdown menu of performance dates visible when a
patron is buying or making a reservation for that production.  To do
this, you can put "Cancelled" (or "Rescheduled", or whatever is
appropriate) in the "Description (optional)" field on this same
screen.

Finally, Save Changes.

**Note:** If you only want to stop certain _types_ of tickets from
being used for advance sales, on the show's main page, rather than
clicking on the performance date, click on the triangle to the left of
the performance date.  This will reveal all ticket redemptions valid
for that performance. You can click on any of these to change the
advance sales limits, or you can also stop advance sales on any ticket
type by setting its "End sales date" to a date in the past.
