To fulfill telephone sales for a patron, you must [locate or add the
patron]({% post_url 2017-10-28-looking-up-a-customer %}), and once you
are viewing their "My Tickets" screen, click the "Buy Tickets" tab.

From that point on, you can enter information on behalf of the patron as if they were making the purchase themselves online.  There are a few differences, however. As a box office staff member, you can also record the purchase as Check or Cash, whereas customer self-purchases can only be paid by credit card.

Also, as a box office staff member, you can override constraints or restrictions. For example, box office staff can sell tickets after the max advanced sales limit has already been reached, or reserve a premium seat for a patron using a ticket that is only valid for balcony seats.
