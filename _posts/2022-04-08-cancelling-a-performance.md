Sometimes it happens: you unexpectedly need to cancel or reschedule a performance
for which tickets have been issued.  Audience1st can help ease the
pain of notifying and reaccommodating your patrons.

There are two possible scenarios:

1. You want to reschedule an existing performance, but keep all or
   most reservations the same.  That is, mostly the same patrons will
   come to that performance, just on a different date.
   In that case, read \[this article\]({
   post_url 2022-04-08-rescheduling-a-performance }).
2. You want to cancel a performance, reaccommodating patrons to
   various other
   existing performances or possibly to a new performance yet to be
   added.  This article tells you how to do it.

The basic steps
are:

1. Immediately halt any further sales/reservations for the cancelled
   performance
2. (Optional) If desired, arrange for single-ticket buyers
   (non-subscribers) to be able to reaccommodate themselves.
   (Subscribers can generally do this already, unless you've taken
   specific steps in Season Setup to prevent it.)
3. Notify patrons.

## Step 1. Stop sales for the affected performance

[This article]({% post_url 2022-04-08-stopping-sales %}) explains how
to immediately stop all sales and reservations for a performance.

Do this step for each cancelled performance.

## Step 2. (Optional) Arrange for single-ticket buyers to reaccommodate themselves.

When you first set up your single-ticket revenue vouchers, you may have left unchecked the option for "Self-changes allowed."  In such cases, cancelling, refunding, or changing a single-ticket buyer's ticket requires box office intervention.

You may prefer to handle it the same way for reaccommodating
single-ticket buyers when a performance is cancelled.  But you also
have the option of allowing them to reaccommodate themselves without
box office intervention, by following these steps:

1. Go to Vouchers and filter to show Regular Revenue Vouchers.  Select
   a revenue voucher that has redemptions valid for the cancelled
   performance and click on its name to edit it.
2. Check the box "Self-changes allowed" and save changes.
3. Make a note to yourself that after the dust settles from the
   cancelled performance, you should restore the previous value of this
   checkbox if needed.

While enabling self-changes on regular revenue vouchers temporarily can ease the burden on theater staff by allowing single ticket buyers affected by the performance cancellation to reschedule themselves without help from the box office, there are some significant side-effects that should be considered before choosing this approach.

Allowing self-change on a regular revenue voucher will also give the buyer the option to _refund_ their own purchases of these vouchers. Also, this change affects all vouchers of this type and not necessarily just the ones purchased for the cancelled performance. These are impacts which most theaters normally don't want; but presumably cancelling a performance is a special case.

## Step 3: Notify patrons

Assuming you have MailChimp connected to Audience1st, the following
will let you compose an email to notify all patrons _with valid email addresses_.
In practice, this should be everyone except patrons that were
hand-entered without an email address by box office staff.

The idea is to identify all affected patrons, export that list to
Mailchimp, and compose and send an email there.
[This article]({% post_url 2022-04-08-contacting-patrons-by-show %})
explains how to do it.

## Other patrons

You'll probably still have to handle some patrons' change requests
manually, but hopefully the steps above will let you reach most of the
affected patrons rapidly and let them choose their own dates.
