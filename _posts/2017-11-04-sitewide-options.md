Audience1st has a variety of site-wide options you can set; most of them
will only be set once, but some you may find useful to change
periodically.
All can be found by clicking the Options tab on the main navbar (you
must be logged in as Box Office Manager or higher to see this tab).

Hover over the question mark icon
![questionmark](../assets/question.png) next to each setting on that
screen for more
information about what that setting controls.

**Important:** You must click the Save button at the bottom of the
screen for your changes to take effect.  They will typically take effect
within a few minutes.

Most of the options are self-explanatory, but a few that deserve
special mention include:

## Stylesheet URL

You can 
[customize the appearance]({% post_url 2020-02-09-css-styling %}) of all
Audience1st patron-facing screens using Cascading Style Sheets.  To do so,
create your stylesheet, post it somewhere publicly available and accessible via
a Secure HTTP (`https`) URL, and enter that URL here.  Here are suggestions for
where to store your CSS page free of charge:

* If your theater's separate website has a static content area (for example,
WordPress-based sites have directories from which static assets such as images
are publicly served), host the file there

* Host it in a public repository on GitHub or GitLab, and use a service such as
[JSdelivr](https://jsdelivr.net) to serve it directly from there

* Host it on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and serve from there

Note that when you update your stylesheet, depending on how it is hosted, it may
take a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
