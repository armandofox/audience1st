To add a new show (production), click the Season tab and then "Add New Show".  (It doesn't matter what season is currently shown when you click "Add New Show"; you will specify what season the new show belongs to as you create it.)

Fill in the information about the new show; you can hover over the question-mark icons for information about what each field represents. Click "Create" when done, or "Back to List of Shows" to cancel the operation.

Once a show has been created, it will appear in the list when you click
the Season tab.  (**Note:** Keep in mind that if it's currently 2021 and you are adding shows in the 2022 season, in order to see them in the list you will need to select 2022 from the "Listing shows for season:" dropdown menu.)

Click on "\[Link\]" next to the name of an existing show to get a popup
window showing a link that takes the customer directly to a purchase
page pre-populated for that show.  You can copy and paste this link onto
your theater's website or into an announcement email.

You can click on an existing show's name to modify any of the information you added, except for the season. (To move a show from one season to another, you will need to delete the show and create it again in the new season.) Continue this process until all shows are added.

## Adding Show Dates (Performances) to Each Show

Click on the name of a show to see its details, including its list of performance dates at the bottom of the page.  To add new performance dates, click "Add Performances...". You can add multiple show dates in one step if all of the show dates share common attributes such as the curtain time. 

Suppose the show will have a performance every Friday and Saturday at 8 pm and every Sunday at 2 pm, each weekend in October. You can add all of the Friday and Saturday performances in one step by checking off Friday and Saturday, setting the time to 8 pm, and using the date picker to select October 1-31. You can then click the "Save & Add More Dates for This Show" button. Next, check off Sunday, set the start time to 2 pm, and again specify a date range of October 1-31. This time click "Save & Back to List of Shows".

If the performances follow a common pattern but there are just a few anomalies, you might still choose to create the performances in one step. Then you can go back and individually edit the anomalies. In the example above with shows every weekend in October, suppose you want to give the first Friday performance a description of "Opening night". You can still create all of the Friday and Saturday performances in one step and then edit the first Friday performance to fill in its description.

You may add dates to a show individually or multiple at one time.  Continue adding performances until all the performances for this show have been added.  It doesn't matter in what order you add performances, as they'll always be listed in date order.

## General Admission or Reserved Seating?

Audience1st supports both general admission (GA) and reserved seating (RS).  For
a complete description of how reserved seating works and how to set up
seat maps, see [this
article]({% post_url 2020-02-18-reserved-seating %}).

At the time each show date is set up, you choose whether it will be GA
or RS.  (This means that you can have some performances of a
production be GA and others RS if you wish.)

When you set up a performance as GA, you enter a number representing
the maximum house capacity, that is, the actual number of patrons that
can be seated.  When you set up a performance as RS, the house
capacity is determined by the number of seats in the seat map.  
In either case, you can (and probably should) set the maximum advance
sales to a lower
number in order to hold back some seats.

**Once the first ticket to a performance has been sold, you cannot
change that performance from GA to RS or vice versa.**  For RS
performances, it is possible to change which seat map is used, as long
as all patrons with current seat reservations can be accommodated.
(For example, some existing reserved seats may not exist in the new
seat map.)  If
you try to make such a change and some patrons cannot be accommodated,
you'll be told which patrons need to have their reservations cancelled
and rebooked, with links to each patron's "My Tickets" page to help
you do that.  But in general, if you think you might have to change seat maps after tickets have
been sold, make the initial seat map the most restrictive, so that any
other seat map you might change to still has all the seats of the
original seat map.
