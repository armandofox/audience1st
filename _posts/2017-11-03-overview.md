To set up a new season, you need Box Office Manager privilege or higher.

A season has a start date (opening night of the season, usually), which
is set during the one-time setup of Admin Options.  Any references to
"the season" use that boundary.  So if the season start date is September 2,
then the "2014-2015 season" runs from September 2, 2014, to September 1,
2015 (even if there are no shows after, say, May).  If the start date is set to January 1 so that the season
coincides with the calendar year, Audience1st will refer simply to "the
2015 season".

A typical season setup consists of these steps:

1. A season consists of one or more **shows** or productions.  Each show has one or more **show dates** or performances.  Season setup begins with adding shows and then show dates for each show.
2. A **voucher type** represents a particular type of ticket: a reserved seat, general admission, discount admission, comp ticket, and so on.  A given voucher type is only valid during a particular season, though you can easily "clone" a voucher type from a previous season in setting up this season.  So the next step in season setup is indicating which voucher types are in use this season.
3. Finally, a **redemption** specifies which kinds of vouchers can be
   sold for which performances.  In effect, a redemption "connects" a set
   of performances to a set of voucher types.  For example, you might offer
   a "Matinee Discount" voucher that is valid for matinees but not evening
   shows.  The final step in season setup is associating voucher types with
   show dates, and optionally, capacity controls (you may want to hold back
   a certain number of house seats on opening night, or you may want to
   limit the number of "special discount" tickets that can be sold for any
   one performance).
