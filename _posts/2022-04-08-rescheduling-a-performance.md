Sometimes it happens: you unexpectedly need to cancel or reschedule a performance
for which tickets have been issued.  Audience1st can help ease the
pain of notifying and reaccommodating your patrons.

There are two possible scenarios:

1. You want to reschedule an existing performance, but keep all or
most reservations the same.  That is, mostly the same patrons will
come to that performance, just on a different date.
This article tells you how to do it.

2. You want to cancel a performance, reaccommodating patrons to
various other
existing performances or possibly to a new performance yet to be
added.  In that case, read [this article]({
