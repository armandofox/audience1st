Sometimes it happens: you unexpectedly need to cancel or reschedule a performance
for which tickets have been issued.  Audience1st can help ease the
pain of notifying and reaccommodating your patrons.

There are two possible scenarios:

1. You want to reschedule an existing performance, but keep all or
most reservations the same.  That is, mostly the same patrons will
come to that performance, just on a different date.
This article tells you how to do it.

2. You want to cancel a performance, reaccommodating patrons to
various other
existing performances or possibly to a new performance yet to be
added.  In that case, read [this article]({

The basic steps to reschedule a performance are:

1. (Optional) Immediately halt any further sales/reservations for the
rescheduled performance.

2. Notify patrons.

3. Reschedule the performance.

## Step 1: Halt further sales/reservations

[This article]({% post_url 2022-04-08-stopping-sales %}) explains how
to immediately stop all sales and reservations for a performance. 

## Step 2: Notify patrons

Assuming you have MailChimp connected to Audience1st, you can
compose an email to notify all patrons _with valid email addresses_. 
In practice, this should be everyone except patrons that were
hand-entered without an email address by box office staff.

The idea is to identify all affected patrons, export that list to
Mailchimp, and compose and send an email there.

explains how to do it.

You'll probably still have to handle some patrons' change requests
manually, but hopefully the steps above will let you reach most of the
affected patrons rapidly and let them choose their own dates.

## Step 3: Reschedule the performance

In the Season tab, click on the show name, and then the performance
date.
A screen for editing performance details will come up.
Change the date of the performance on that screen, and Save Changes.

Next--and this is important--you will need to look through the
Redemptions associated with that performance to adjust the start/end
sales dates of each ticket type.  (This isn't necessary for patrons
who already have tickets for this performance, but it is necessary if
you want to allow additional patrons to purchase tickets for the new
rescheduled date.)  On the show's main screen under
Season, click the triangle to the left of the rescheduled
performance.  A list of redemptions will appear, showing the start and
end sales dates for each ticket type valid for that performance.  You
will need to edit these one at a time.  A pro tip is to Shift-click or
Control-click (on Mac computers, Command-click), which opens each
redemption's details in a new browser window or tab while keeping the
original window or tab open so you can quickly go on to the next
redemption.
