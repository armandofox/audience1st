# This information is for developers and deployers

Perhaps you intended to [learn about Audience1st features and/or have us install and host it for you](https://www.audience1st.com)?

You only need the information in this repo and its wiki if you are
deploying and maintaining Audience1st yourself.  If so, the wiki
assumes you are IT-savvy and provides the information needed to help
you get this Rails ~>4 / Ruby ~>2 app deployed.

The high order bits for developers:

* You need Rails ~>4 and Ruby ~>2.

* You need a Stripe account, though you can use just the test-mode keys during development.

* Audience1st is designed for multi-tenancy, and by default uses
Heroku Postgres schemas per tenant.  The wiki includes instructions on
how to make multi-tenancy work with non-Postgres databases or disable
it entirely.

* Audience1st uses Sendgrid to send transactional emails, using
ActionMailer pointed at the Sendgrid SMTP server.  However, you can
easily disable transactional email even in production, so you don't
need a Sendgrid account.

# Want to help with hosting or front-line customer support?

We want to make it appealing for as many small-to-medium-sized
nonprofit theaters as possible to adopt Audience1st.  That involves
customer/tech support, onboarding, and 
many other crucial but nontechnical roles.  Contact me if you want to
help! 

# Want to contribute?  Found a bug?

That'd be great!  I use [Pivotal Tracker
project](https://pivotaltracker.com/projects/44802)  (not GitHub
Issues) to manage the project.  Contact me if you want to help,
there's lots to do.  You know the drill: fork, develop, **make sure
you have lots of tests,** rebase, PR.

Questions welcome!
